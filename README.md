This is a copy of the [Spring Boot Sample Web JSP project](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-samples/spring-boot-sample-web-jsp) from GitHub.  

I copied it out and am in the process of modifying it to do the following:

 * Standalone build, without dependency on the larger [Spring Boot project](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot) and its parent Maven Project.
 * Provide a Gradle Build, using the Gradle Wrapper.
 * Swap out logback for log4j2 (I'm more familiar/comfortable with log4j, having used it for over a decade)
 
These are my immediate needs.

I eventually want to build this out so that it contains sample JSP pages with Twitter Bootstrap integrated. 

I need a seed project for building Web-based Spring Boot applications that I can quickly fork for other personal development projects.
